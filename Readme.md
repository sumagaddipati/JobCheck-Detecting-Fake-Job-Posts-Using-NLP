**JobShield AI – Fake Job Post Detection System**

**Project Overview**

JobShield AI is an intelligent, web-based system designed to detect fraudulent job postings using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).

The system analyzes job descriptions and job posters (via OCR) to classify postings as FAKE or REAL. In addition to classification, it generates a Risk Score, Risk Level, and human-readable explanations using Explainable AI (XAI), ensuring transparency and trust.

This project is designed with a strong focus on real-world applicability, secure system architecture, and user accessibility, making it suitable for recruitment platforms, job portals, and fraud detection systems.
